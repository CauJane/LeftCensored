# A General Zero-inflated Left-Censored Testing Approach with a Single Detection Limit for Environmental Exposure
The simulation code and full implementation details are introduced here.
The file `simulation_codes.R` describes the computational process of a simulation.
The folder `smy_files` stores the summary results of each simulation calculation.
The file `water_single.xlsx` records 22 pesticide residues from 241 water plants in China between 2008 and 2012.
The file `figPlot.R` shows the visualization results of simulation calculations and real data analysis.
